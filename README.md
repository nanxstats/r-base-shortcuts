## Object creation

### Create sequences with `seq_len()` and `seq_along()`

`seq_len()` and `seq_along()` are safer than `1:length(x)` or `1:nrow(x)`
because they avoid the unexpected result when `x` is of length `0`:

```r
# Safe version of 1:length(x)
seq_len(length(x))
# Safe version of 1:length(x)
seq_along(x)
```

### Create an empty list of a given length

Use the `vector()` function to create an empty list of a specific length:

```r
x <- vector("list", length)
```

### Create and assigning S3 classes in one step

Avoid creating an object and assigning its class separately.
Instead, use the `structure()` function to do both at once:

```r
x <- structure(list(), class = "my_class")
```

Instead of:

```r
x <- list()
class(x) <- "my_class"
```

This makes the code more concise when returning an object of a specific class.

### Assign names to vector elements or data frame columns at creation

The `setNames()` function allows you to assign names to vector elements or
data frame columns during creation:

```r
x <- setNames(1:3, c("one", "two", "three"))
x <- setNames(data.frame(...), c("names", "of", "columns"))
```

### Use `I()` to include objects as is in data frames

The `I()` function allows you to include objects as is when creating data frames:

```r
df <- data.frame(x = I(list(1:10, letters)))
df$x
#> [[1]]
#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
#>
#> [[2]]
#>  [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m"
#> [14] "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"
```

This creates a data frame with one column `x` that is a list of vectors.

### Generate factors using `gl()`

Create a vector with specific levels with `gl()` by specifying the levels
and the number of repetitions:

```r
gl(n = 2, k = 5, labels = c("Low", "High"))
#> [1] Low  Low  Low  Low  Low  High High High High High
#> Levels: Low High
```

The `gl()` function is particularly useful when setting up experiments
or simulations that involve categorical variables.

## Object transformation

### Use `[` and `[[` as functions in apply calls

When you need to extract the same element from each item in a list or
list-like object, you can leverage `[` and `[[` as functions
(they actually are!) within `lapply()` and `sapply()` calls.

Consider a list of named vectors:

```r
lst <- list(
  item1 = c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3),
  item2 = c(a = 4, b = 5, c = 6),
  item3 = c(a = 7, b = 8, c = 9)
)

# Extract named element "a" using `[[`
element_a <- sapply(lst, `[[`, "a")

lst <- list(
  item1 = c(1, 2, 3),
  item2 = c(4, 5, 6),
  item3 = c(7, 8, 9)
)

# Extract first element using `[`
first_element <- sapply(lst, `[`, 1)
```

### Sum all components in a list

Use the `Reduce()` function with the infix function `+` to sum up all components
in a list:

```r
x <- Reduce("+", list)
```

### Bind multiple data frames in a list

The `do.call()` function with the `rbind` argument allows you to bind
multiple data frames in a list into one data frame:

```r
df_combined <- do.call("rbind", list_of_dfs)
```

Alternatively, more performant solutions for such operations are offered in
`data.table::rbindlist()` and `dplyr::bind_rows()`. See
[this article](https://rpubs.com/jimhester/rbind) for details.

### Use `modifyList()` to update a list

The `modifyList()` function allows you to easily update values in a list
without a verbose syntax:

```r
old_list <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
new_vals <- list(a = 10, c = 30)
new_list <- modifyList(defaults, new_vals)
```

This can be very useful for maintaining and updating a set of
configuration parameters.

### Run-length encoding

Run-length encoding is a simple form of data compression in which sequences
of the same element are replaced by a single instance of the element followed
by the number of times it appears in the sequence.

Suppose you have a vector with many repeating elements:

```r
x <- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)
```

You can use `rle()` to compress this vector and decompress the result back
into the original vector with `inverse.rle()`:

```r
x <- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)

(y <- rle(x))
#> Run Length Encoding
#>   lengths: int [1:5] 3 2 4 3 2
#>   values : num [1:5] 1 2 3 2 1

inverse.rle(y)
#> [1] 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1
```

## Conditions

### Use `inherits()` for class checking

Instead of using the `class()` function in conjunction with `==`, `!=`,
or `%in%` operators to check if an object belongs to a certain class,
use the `inherits()` function.

```r
if (inherits(x, "class"))
```

This will return `TRUE` if "class" is one of the classes from which `x` inherits.
This replaces the following more verbose forms:

```r
if (class(x) == "class")
```

or

```r
if (class(x) %in% c("class1", "class2"))
```

It is also more reliable because it checks for class inheritance,
not just the first class name (R supports multiple classes for S3 and S4 objects).

### Replace multiple `ifelse()` with `cut()`

For a series of range-based conditions, use `cut()` instead of chaining
multiple `if-else` conditions or `ifelse()` calls:

```r
categories <- cut(
  x,
  breaks = c(-Inf, 0, 10, Inf),
  labels = c("negative", "small", "large")
)
```

This assigns each element in `x` to the category that corresponds to the
range it falls in.

### Replace multiple `ifelse()` with `factor()`

If you want to define a logic to change character values, 
use `factor` instead of chaining multiple `if-else` conditions: 

```r
x <- c("M", "F", "F", NA)
factor(
  x, 
  levels = c("F", "M", NA), 
  labels = c("Female", "Male", "Missing"), 
  exclude = NULL   # encode missing values
)
```

### Save the number of `if` conditions with upcasting

Sometimes, the number of conditions checked in multiple `if` statements
can be reduced by cleverly using the fact that in R,
`TRUE` is upcasted to `1` and `FALSE` to `0` in numeric contexts.
This can be useful for selecting an index based on a set of conditions:

```r
i <- (width >= 960) + (width >= 1140) + 1
p <- p + facet_wrap(vars(class), ncol = c(1, 2, 4)[i])
```

This does the same thing as the following code, but in a much more concise way:

```r
if (width >= 1140) p <- p + facet_wrap(vars(class), ncol = 4)
if (width >= 960 & width < 1140) p <- p + facet_wrap(vars(class), ncol = 2)
if (width < 960) p <- p + facet_wrap(vars(class), ncol = 1)
```

This works because the condition checks in the parentheses result in a
`TRUE` or `FALSE`, and when they are added together, they are
upcasted to `1` or `0`.

### Use `findInterval()` for many breakpoints

If you want to assign a variable to many different groups or intervals,
instead of using a series of `if` statements, you can use the
`findInterval()` function. Using the same example above:

```r
breakpoints <- c(960, 1140)
ncols <- c(1, 2, 4)
i <- findInterval(width, breakpoints) + 1
p <- p + facet_wrap(vars(class), ncol = ncols[i])
```

The `findInterval()` function finds which interval each number in a
given vector falls into and returns a vector of interval indices.
It's a faster alternative when there are many breakpoints.

## Vectorization

### Use `match()` for fast lookups

The `match()` function can be faster than `which()` for looking up
values in a vector:

```r
index <- match(value, my_vector)
```

This code sets `index` to the index of `value` in `my_vector`.

### Use `mapply()` for element-wise operations on multiple lists

`mapply()` applies a function over a set of lists in an element-wise fashion:

```r
mapply(sum, list1, list2, list3)
```

### Simplify element-wise min and max operations with `pmin()` and `pmax()`

When comparing two or more vectors on an element-wise basis and get the
minimum or maximum of each set of elements, use `pmin()` and `pmax()`.

```r
vec1 <- c(1, 5, 3, 9, 5)
vec2 <- c(4, 2, 8, 1, 7)

# Instead of using sapply() or a loop:
sapply(1:length(vec1), function(i) min(vec1[i], vec2[i]))
sapply(1:length(vec1), function(i) max(vec1[i], vec2[i]))

# Use pmin() and pmax() for a more concise and efficient solution:
pmin(vec1, vec2)
pmax(vec1, vec2)
```

`pmin()` and `pmax()` perform these operations much more efficiently than
alternatives such as applying `min()` and `max()` in a loop or using `sapply()`.
This can lead to a noticeable performance improvement when working with large vectors.

### Apply a function to all combinations of parameters

Sometimes we need to run a function on every combination of a set of
parameter values, for example, in grid search. We can use the combination of
`expand.grid()`, `mapply()`, and `do.call()` + `rbind()` to accomplish this.

Suppose we have a simple function that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`:

```r
f <- function(a, b) {
  result <- a * b
  data.frame(a = a, b = b, result = result)
}
```

Create a grid of `a` and `b` parameter values to evaluate:

```r
params <- expand.grid(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)
```

We use `mapply()` to apply `f` to each row of our parameter grid.
We will use `SIMPLIFY = FALSE` to keep the results as a list of data frames:

```r
lst <- mapply(f, a = params$a, b = params$b, SIMPLIFY = FALSE)
```

Finally, we bind all the result data frames together into one final data frame:

```r
do.call(rbind, lst)
```

### Generate all possible combinations of given characters

To generate all possible combinations of a given set of characters,
`expand.grid()` and `do.call()` with `paste0()` can help.
The following snippet produces all possible three-digit character
strings consisting of both letters (lowercase) and numbers:

```r
x <- c(letters, 0:9)
do.call(paste0, expand.grid(x, x, x))
```

Here, `expand.grid()` generates a data frame where each row is a unique
combination of three elements from `x`. Then, `do.call(paste0, ...)`
concatenates each combination together into a string.

### Vectorize a function with `Vectorize()`

If a function is not natively vectorized (it has arguments that only take
one value at a time), you can use `Vectorize()` to create a new function
that accepts vector inputs:

```r
f <- function(x) x^2
lower <- c(1, 2, 3)
upper <- c(4, 5, 6)

integrate_vec <- Vectorize(integrate, vectorize.args = c("lower", "upper"))

result <- integrate_vec(f, lower, upper)
unlist(result["value", ])
```

The `Vectorize()` function works internally by leveraging the `mapply()`
function, which applies a function over two or more vectors or lists.

## Functions

### Specify formal argument lists with `alist()`

The `alist()` function can create lists where some elements are intentionally
left blank (or are "missing"), which can be helpful when we want to specify
formal arguments of a function, especially in conjunction with `formals()`.

Consider this scenario. Suppose we are writing a function that wraps another
function, and we want our wrapper function to have the same formal arguments
as the original function, even if it does not use all of them.
Here is how we can use `alist()` to achieve that:

```r
original_function <- function(a, b, c = 3, d = "something") a + b

wrapper_function <- function(...) {
  # Use the formals of the original function
  arguments <- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)$...

  # Update the formals using `alist()`
  formals(wrapper_function) <- alist(a = , b = , c = 3, d = "something")

  # Call the original function
  do.call(original_function, arguments)
}
```

Now, `wrapper_function()` has the same formal arguments as
`original_function()`, and any arguments passed to `wrapper_function()`
are forwarded to `original_function()`. This way, even if `wrapper_function()`
does not use all the arguments, it can still accept them, and code that uses
`wrapper_function()` can be more consistent with code that uses
`original_function()`.

The `alist()` function is used here to create a list of formals where
some elements are missing, which represents the fact that some arguments
are required and have no default values. This would not be possible
with `list()`, which cannot create lists with missing elements.

### Use internal functions without `:::`

To use internal functions from packages without using `:::`, you can use

```r
f <- utils::getFromNamespace("f", ns = "package")
f(...)
```

## Side-effects

### Return invisibly with `invisible()` for side-effect functions

R functions always return a value. However, some functions are primarily
designed for their side effects. To suppress the automatic printing
of the returned value, use `invisible()`.

```r
f <- function(x) {
  print(x^2)
  invisible(x)
}
```

The value of `x` can be used later when the result is assigned to a variable
or piped into the next function.

### Use `on.exit()` for cleanup

`on.exit()` is a useful function for cleaning up side effects, such as
deleting temporary files or closing opened connections, even if a function
exits early due to an error:

```r
f <- function() {
  temp_file <- tempfile()
  on.exit(unlink(temp_file))

  # Do stuff with temp_file
}

f <- function(file) {
  con <- file(file, "r")
  on.exit(close(con))
  readLines(con)
}
```

This function creates a temporary file and then ensures it gets deleted
when the function exits, regardless of why it exits. Note that the arguments
`add` and `after` in `on.exit()` are important for controlling the overwriting
and ordering behavior of the expressions.

## Numeric Computation

### Using `outer` for pairwise computation

The `outer` function allow you to define function
for pairwise computation. Useful in U-statistics.

```r
x <- rnorm(5) 
y <- rnorm(5)

outer(x, y, FUN = function(x,y) x + x^2 - y)
```

### Using `stepfun` for step function 

The `step` function allow you to define a step function. 
Useful in survival analysis. 

e.g. We have two survival curve from KM estimator, 
now we want to know the survival probability difference at a given time. 

```r
library(survival)

fitKM <- survfit(Surv(stop, event=='pcm') ~1, data=mgus1,
                    subset=(start==0))
stepKM <- stepfun(fitKM$time, c(1, fitKM$surv))
            
fitCR <- survfit(Surv(stop, event == "death") ~1,
                    data=mgus1, subset=(start==0))
stepCR <- stepfun(fitCR$time, c(1, fitCR$surv))
        
t <- 1:3 * 1000            
stepKM(t) - stepCR(t)        
```
